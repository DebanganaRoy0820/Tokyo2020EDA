# Tokyo2020EDA
Tried doing an EDA with the 2021 Olympics Dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo
Shows insights regarding participants, countries, coaches and medals. 😄🥇🥈🥉🏃‍♀️🏊‍♀️🤼‍ 
Actual EDA link is https://www.kaggle.com/debanganaroy/2021-tokyo-olympics-eda-beginner-using-plotly/notebook: Do leave an upvote if you like the work. 😅
